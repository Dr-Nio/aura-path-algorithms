## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **AURA**, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**  
   Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to protect users.

2. **Contact the maintainers securely:**  
   - Send an email to: **security@aura.dev** (replace with actual project email).  
   - Use the subject: `SECURITY VULNERABILITY REPORT`.

3. Include in your report (if possible):  
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.  
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.  
   - Potential impact and severity.  
   - Any suggested mitigations or fixes.

## Security Response Process

- The security team will acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**.  
- A fix or mitigation will be developed privately, and relevant contributors may be contacted under responsible disclosure.  
- Once resolved, a patched release will be published, and security notes will be added to the changelog.  
- Public disclosure will only occur **after** the fix is released.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Core algorithm logic.  
- ES package and benchmarks.  
- Documentation and examples (where relevant).  

It does **not** apply to third-party dependencies. If the vulnerability lies within an external library, please report it upstream.
