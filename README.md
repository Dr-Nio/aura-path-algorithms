 AURA - Advanced Unified Routing Algorithms: A modern ES package providing graph shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall) with benchmarks and tests.

**Elegant AI-driven routing with balance, performance, and adaptability.**

---

## 🌌 Introduction

**AURA (Adaptive Unified Routing Algorithm)** is a next-generation algorithmic framework designed to **optimize routing, balancing, and resource distribution** in dynamic systems.  
It redefines efficiency by combining **adaptive learning**, **statistical weight redistribution**, and **benchmark-driven evaluation** into a unified ecosystem.  

Born from the evolution of the **Weighted Balance Redistribution (WBR)** concept, AURA introduces a more **modular, scalable, and AI-aligned approach** that is intuitive, powerful, and future-proof.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **🔄 Adaptive Unified Routing**  
  Dynamically balances load, routes intelligently, and adapts to real-time changes.

- **📊 ES Package with Benchmarking**  
  Includes the **Evaluation & Simulation (ES)** module for performance benchmarking, enabling precise testing across different workloads.

- **⚖️ Weighted Balance Redistribution (Legacy)**  
  Retains the original WBR logic as a compatibility layer, ensuring backward support.

- **⚡ High Performance**  
  Built with efficient computational techniques to ensure scalability across diverse systems.

- **🧩 Modular Architecture**  
  Plug-and-play design makes AURA suitable for **networking, distributed systems, AI routing, logistics optimization, and more.**

## 🌟 Why AURA?
Unlike traditional algorithms, AURA feels alive:

Adaptive – learns and adjusts dynamically

Unified – integrates routing, balancing, and benchmarking seamlessly

Resilient – optimized for edge cases and dynamic scaling

Aesthetic – designed with clarity and modern engineering best practices

AURA is more than an algorithm—it’s a framework for intelligent balance.
